# OverTheWire: Bandit Walkthrough

This folder contains my complete walkthrough of the [OverTheWire: Bandit](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) wargame â€” a hands-on Linux-based challenge designed to build foundational skills in command-line operations, file system navigation, permissions, and networking.

This game is part of my journey into DevOps and Linux fundamentals. Itâ€™s an ideal way to sharpen real-world shell skills through progressively harder scenarios.
