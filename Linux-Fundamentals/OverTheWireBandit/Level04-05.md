## 🧐 Notes

- **What did you learn?**  
  How to identify file types using the `file` command and isolate human-readable (ASCII text) files.

- **Any new command/tool?**  
  `file` — tells you what type of content a file holds.

- **Anything tricky?**  
  Most of the files were binary. Only one showed as ASCII text. Easy to miss if you don’t read `file` output carefully.
