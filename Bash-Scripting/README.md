# üß† Bash Battle Arena

**Bash Battle Arena** is a gamified learning journey designed to build and improve your Bash scripting skills through hands-on challenges. It begins with simple tasks and gradually introduces more complex concepts involving file manipulation, conditionals, functions, loops, and more advanced scripting techniques.

Each level presents a mission (or series of missions) that you complete by writing a Bash script. By solving these challenges, you'll not only improve your shell scripting ability but also develop the mindset of a true "Bash Master" üí•.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è This game is played locally on your system ‚Äì no VM or website required. Your mission scripts are saved and tracked through Git version control or local directories.
